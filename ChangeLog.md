# Changelog for water-cooler

## 0.1.1.1
 * Updated `next` time to include sub-hours and sub-minutes if appropriate.  I.e. 1h30m.

## 0.1.1.0
 * The water-cooler `next` command now prints time until the next drink in "human-friendly" time.
   I.e. instead of "120s" it will print "2m".
   Currently it uses the floor calculation; therefore "119s" would show as "1m"
